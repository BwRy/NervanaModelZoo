#Deep reinforcement learning

An implementation of a deep Q-network that can learn to play video games based on [Mnih et. al. Nature 2015](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html).

This was developed by Tambet Matiisen at University of Tartu in Estonia.  Code and instructions for use can be found at [simple_dqn](https://github.com/tambetm/simple_dqn).  Trained model snapshots are provided in the repo as well ([link to snapshots](https://github.com/tambetm/simple_dqn/tree/master/snapshots)).
